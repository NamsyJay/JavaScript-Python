STEPS:
Install Dependencies:
   1) Python, React and Nodejs.
      - npm create vite@latest Frontend -- --template react
      - then cd frontend
      - npm install
      - npm run dev
   2) In this application, build the API.
      - create a CRUD
      - create Routes.
   3) Change Directory to the backend folder, then install the necessary packages for the backend(Python).
      - sudo apt install python3-flask
      (Challenges installing Packages)
         - "sudo apt search SQLAlchemy" (This helps identity the appropriate package).
         - "apt install python3-flask-sqlalchemy" (This was the command that eventually worked).
         - "apt install python3-flask-cors" (This is "cross origin request")
   4) Create files in the Backend folder.
      - "main.py" - (Main endpoints of the Application).
      - "models.py" - (Database models for the application).
      - "config.py" - (Configurations of our applications).
   5) BACKEND:
      - import flask, flask sqlalchemy, cors (allows requests to be sent from a different url)
      - The above will be done in the config.py file
      - The models.py file will have credentials.
   6) FRONTEND:
